# Genetic Programming: Symbolic Regression
This project is my first draft of reproducing the introductory symbolic regression project from John R. Koza's Genetic Programming Volume 1. It still needs some work. My intention is to develop it further and experiment with regression and classification on well-known datasets such as the titanic dataset.
